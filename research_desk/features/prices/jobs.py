"""``prices update [--codes 005930,080220]``: the daily KIS price snapshot and the year of adjusted
closes behind it (spec §8, §11).

``register(subparsers)`` adds ``prices`` and its subcommand ``update``; the window exports it as
``register_jobs`` for ``cli.py``. The command function returns the exit code.

- 4 = not ready. Checked before anything else, in this order: the DB settings (SUPABASE_URL,
  SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY), the KIS keys (KIS_APP_KEY, KIS_APP_SECRET), the stock list
  (KRX_CSV_PATH) loads. One Korean line on stderr; no DB or KIS call, nothing written. A
  PRICES_MAX_CALLS_PER_SEC that is not a number above 0 is a ValueError (exit 1), also before any
  call.
- The KIS access token is asked for once a run, before any stock (spec §8: KIS issues about one
  a minute, and the app key is shared with another project). Without it nothing else is asked
  (the full run's step 2, ``--codes``), and the KIS client does not ask for it again.
- A full run (no ``--codes``) covers every stock of the stock list (each valid code once, in
  file order):
  1. a run record ``running`` (started_at, stocks_total);
  2. the access token. When it cannot be had (a KIS error or a strange answer) the run is failed
     at once: no stock is asked and no snapshot changes; the run record is closed with no stock
     received, every stock counted as failed and the message ``KIS 접근 토큰을 받지 못했습니다
     (<reason>). …``, which also ends the summary line on stderr; exit 1;
  3. per stock, one after another, paced by the KIS client at PRICES_MAX_CALLS_PER_SEC: the
     adjusted daily prices of the ``LOOKBACK_DAYS`` (380) calendar days up to today (KST), three
     KIS calls of 100 rows, then the quote. A KIS error, a strange answer or no usable row is that
     stock's failure (one warning line each). Once more than 20 % of the stocks have failed the
     run is failed whatever comes next, so the rest are not asked;
  4. the status (``logic.run_status``). ok / partial: the received stocks are upserted with the
     excess against this run's market medians, and the stocks not received keep their stored
     values and get the ``no_data`` flag (a stock without a stored row gets none). Then the
     received stocks' adjusted closes go to the history (``stock_price_daily``): only the new
     days, or the stock's whole series when its stored history is missing, shorter or differs
     (``logic.history_rows``, decided from the snapshot as_of read before the upsert and the
     stored closes on the probe days); the stocks not received keep theirs. Last, the history
     before the window's first day is deleted, for every stock (also ones no longer in the
     list). failed: no snapshot or history changes;
  5. the run record is closed with the status, as_of (the latest day received), the counts and a
     message;
  6. one summary line: stdout for ok / partial (exit 0), stderr for failed (exit 1).
  An exception on the way closes the run record as failed and goes up: Python prints it and the
  process ends with 1. Ctrl+C also closes the run record as failed and goes up, but the process
  then ends with the interpreter's interrupt code, not 1 (on Windows 0xC000013A, which
  PowerShell shows as -1073741510). What was written before stays (the snapshots are written
  before the history); the next run finds no history row on a rewritten snapshot's day and writes
  that stock's whole series again.
- ``--codes`` is a check. The access token comes first: without it nothing is asked or read and
  nothing goes to stdout (one line on stderr, exit 1). Then only those codes are asked and their
  computed rows printed as JSON, then one summary line. Nothing is written (no snapshot, no run
  record, no history). Excess uses the market medians of every stored snapshot, blank when there
  is none. A code not in the stock list is not asked. Exit 0 when every code was received, else 1
  (summary on stderr).

Heavy imports (the KIS client with its HTTP library, supabase-py) happen when the command runs:
``cli.py`` imports this module for every command. Output holds no key: KIS errors are masked by
the client. The command first sets stdout and stderr to write ``?`` for a character their
encoding lacks instead of failing: piped or redirected output on Korean Windows is cp949, and an
error text from KIS or the network can hold characters it has not (an en dash, ``é``). The
encoding stays; the run record keeps the text as it was.
