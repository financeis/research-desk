"""Compare (두 보고서 비교): two reports of the same company side by side, and their narrative.

Public: ``router`` — ``GET /api/compare?left=&right=`` and ``POST /api/compare/analyze``
(spec §6, §9.6).

Compare reads reports only through ``reports.get_report``. For a new narrative it holds both
reports busy (``analysis.hold_reports``, the marker analysis and delete share; 409 when one is
busy), reads their saved analyses again under the hold, takes one of the web server's 2 AI slots
(``analysis.ai_slot``, shared with analysis), gets the AI connection, model and time limit from
``analysis.phase2_llm`` and saves through ``analysis.save_comparison``; it reads no Phase 2
setting and no table itself.
