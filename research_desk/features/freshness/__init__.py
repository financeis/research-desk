"""Freshness (자료 기준일): how current the price snapshot, the investor flows and the newest report
are, for the status line on top of every screen (spec §12.3, §12.5).

- ``router``: ``GET /api/freshness`` (no request values) →

      {"prices": {"as_of": "YYYY-MM-DD" | null,
                  "last_run_at": "2026-10-08T18:30:00+09:00" | null,
                  "last_run_status": "running" | "ok" | "partial" | "failed" | null,

       "flows": {"as_of": "YYYY-MM-DD" | null,
                 "last_run_at": "2026-10-08T18:45:00+09:00" | null,
                 "last_run_status": "running" | "ok" | "partial" | "failed" | null,

  ``as_of`` is the latest successful (ok / partial) price run's data day, ``last_run_at`` the
  latest run's start (any status); the same for the investor-flow update in ``flows``;
  ``latest_at`` is the newest in-scope report's sent_at; times are in Korea, cut to the second, and
  null when unknown. Prices are stale, ``note`` saying why (the first that fits), when no run has
  ever succeeded (``주가가 아직 한 번도 갱신되지 않았습니다``), when the latest run failed
  (``마지막 주가 갱신이 실패했습니다``), or when ``as_of`` is before the expected trading day
  (``주가가 10월 7일 기준으로 밀려 있습니다. 휴장일이면 정상입니다``); ``note`` is null exactly when
  they are fresh. The flows follow the same rule with their own sentences
  (``수급 자료가 아직 한 번도 갱신되지 않았습니다``, ``마지막 수급 갱신이 실패했습니다``,
  ``수급 자료가 10월 7일 기준으로 밀려 있습니다. 휴장일이면 정상입니다``); a day whose price update
  failed skips the flows update, so it shows the last one. The expected trading day is today when
  it is a weekday at or after 20:00 in Korea (after the 18:30 daily price run and the flows update
  that follows it), else the nearest weekday before today. Reports are stale without any in-scope
  report or when the newest is more than 3 days old; reports have no note. The rules and their
  adjustable values are in ``logic.py``.

The values come from the prices window (``prices.latest_run()``), the flows window
(``flows.latest_run()``) and the reports window (``reports.latest_report_sent_at()``), read in
that order on every request; nothing is cached. Their ``NotReady("주가", …)`` /
``NotReady("수급", …)`` / ``NotReady("리포트", …)`` passes through unchanged (spec §12.4): the route
answers 503 with the sentence of the first that fails, and the next request asks again. This
feature's own name is ``자료 기준일``; it has nothing to prepare.
