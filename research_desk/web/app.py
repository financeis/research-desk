"""The web app: common devices, error answers, screen files and the feature list (spec §6, §9.9).

``create_app(dist=None)`` builds the app the ``web`` command serves. It only registers; the work
happens in the features. The common devices are the old app's (langgraph_tagger/workspace/api.py):

- ``FastAPI(title='Research Desk', docs_url=None, redoc_url=None)``: ``/openapi.json`` stays on,
  the docs pages are off.
- Hosts: only ``127.0.0.1``, ``localhost`` and ``testserver`` (anything else: 400).
- Origins: a request other than GET / HEAD / OPTIONS whose ``Origin`` is not ``127.0.0.1:8520``,
  ``localhost:8520``, ``127.0.0.1:5173`` or ``localhost:5173`` → 403 ``허용되지 않은 요청입니다.``.
  The host check is added first and the origin check second, as before, so the origin check
  still runs first.
- A feature that cannot prepare raises ``core.settings.NotReady`` → 503 ``{"detail": "<기능 이름>
  기능을 지금 쓸 수 없습니다: <이유>"}`` and one warning line in the local log (the reason holds
  no path, key or traceback), so only that feature's addresses stop.
- Any other unexpected error → logged with its traceback, 503 with a fixed sentence.

``GET /api/health`` → ``{"status": "ok"}``, whatever feature is broken. ``FEATURES`` is the one
place features are wired, in this order, each by ``feature_router(feature)`` (spec §13): the
window's ``web_router()`` when it has one, else its ``router``. A window that also binds a command
(``register_jobs``, imported by ``cli.py`` for every command) cannot bind its router, since that
loads FastAPI; it has ``web_router()``, which imports its router when called — so FastAPI and that
feature's web side load when the app is made, never when the window is imported. (Once called,
such a package also has an attribute ``router``: its router submodule, not a router. That is why
``web_router`` is looked at first.)

Screen files come from ``dist`` (default ``DEFAULT_DIST`` = ``<repository>/frontend/dist``). When
that folder exists as the app is made, ``/assets`` serves ``dist/assets``. ``GET /`` serves
``dist/index.html`` with ``Cache-Control: no-cache``, looked up on each request; without it, 503
``프론트엔드를 먼저 빌드해 주세요: cd frontend && npm run build``.

Making the app reads no setting and touches no DB or AI (each feature prepares on first use), and
importing this module makes no app.
