"""Safety net for every web test, and the shared fixtures.

- ``clean_env`` (autouse):
  - every setting a feature could read is deleted; a test that needs one sets it itself;
  - the current folder is a new temp folder, so a relative default (``./reports``,
    ``docs/stock_data/KRX_stocks_data.csv``) never reaches the real files;
  - ``Path.home()`` is a new temp folder, so even a companies service made without a favorites
    path cannot reach ``~/.review_viewer/favorites.json``;
  - ``core.db.supabase_client`` refuses: no real Supabase client, ever (a test that needs a DB
    hands out a stand-in);
  - the features' process-wide state starts fresh and is put back afterwards: the service of
    companies, reports, coverage, review, prices (read by peers, freshness and flows through its
    window), peers, freshness and flows, and analysis' Supabase client and reports in flight.
- ``dist``: a temp screen folder (``index.html``, ``assets/app.js``).
- ``app``: the assembled app on ``dist``; its dependency overrides are cleared afterwards.
- ``stock_csv``: a small stock list holding 016360, with its version file, at ``KRX_CSV_PATH``.
- ``favorites_path`` / ``companies``: the real companies service on a temp favorites file,
  standing in for the app's own (the real favorites file is never used).
